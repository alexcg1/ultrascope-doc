[Image stacking](http://www.instructables.com/id/Astrophotography-Star-Photo-Stacking/)
#### Interpolate

# L
#### Laser cutting
[Laser cutting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser_cutting) is a technology that uses a laser to cut materials, and is typically used for industrial manufacturing applications, but is also starting to be used by schools, small businesses, and hobbyists. Many parts of the Ultrascope can be made by laser cutting.
#### Layering
#### LEO
#### Light curve
A [light curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_curve) is a graph of light intensity of a celestial object or region, over time. For [asteroid observation](http://www.killerasteroids.org/lightcurves.php), this lets you estimate spin and size.
#### LTE
LTE is a 4G mobile communications standard
#### Lumia
Ultrascope uses the [Microsoft Lumia 1020](http://www.microsoft.com/en/mobile/phone/lumia1020/) smartphone for imaging and telescope control
#### Lux

# M
#### Magnitude
#### Microcontroller
A [microcontroller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microcontroller) is a highly integrated chip that contains all the components comprising a controller, for example an Arduino. Unlike a general-purpose computer, which also includes all of these components, a microcontroller is designed for a very specific task -- to control a particular system. As a result, the parts can be simplified and reduced, which cuts down on production costs.
#### Mount
A [telescope mount](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telescope_mount) is a mechanical structure which supports a telescope. Telescope mounts are designed to support the mass of the telescope and allow for accurate pointing of the instrument.
#### MPC (Minor Planet Center)
The [Minor Planet Center (MPC)](http://www.minorplanetcenter.net/iau/mpc.html) is the official organization in charge of collecting observational data for minor planets (asteroids) and comets, calculating their orbits and publishing this information via the Minor Planet Circulars.

# N
#### NEA
#### NEO
#### Noise

# O
#### OAD
#### OnShape

#### Open Hardware
#### Order of Magnitude
If two numbers differ by one [order of magnitude](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_magnitude), one is about ten times larger than the other. If they differ by two orders of magnitude, they differ by a factor of about 100. Two numbers of the same order of magnitude have roughly the same scale: the larger value is less than ten times the smaller value.

# P
#### PCB
A [printed circuit board (PCB)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printed_circuit_board) mechanically supports and electrically connects electronic components using conductive tracks, pads and other features etched from copper sheets laminated onto a non-conductive substrate. PCBs can be single sided (one copper layer), double sided (two copper layers) or multi-layer.
#### Photo layering
#### Python

#### Photometry
[Photometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photometry_%28optics%29) is the science of the measurement of light, in terms of its perceived brightness to the human eye.

# R
#### Rapid prototyping
[Rapid prototyping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_prototyping) is a group of techniques used to quickly fabricate a scale model of a physical part or assembly using 3D CAD data. Construction of the part or assembly is usually done using 3D printing.
#### RAW
#### Raw data
#### Reflector
A [reflecting telescope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflecting_telescope) (also called a reflector) is an optical telescope which uses a single or combination of curved mirrors that reflect light and form an image.
#### Repository (Repo)
A repository is the most basic element of GitHub. They're easiest to imagine as a project's folder. A repository contains all of the project files (including documentation), and stores each file's revision history. Repositories can have multiple collaborators and can be either public or private.

#### SKA
#### Snapdragon
#### Software stack
#### Southern skies
The Northern hemisphere has lots of telescopes, so has relatively good sky coverage. The Southern skies (in the Southern hemisphere: Africa, particularly) don't have so many scopes so coverage is low.
#### SpaceGAMBIT
#### Space Apps Challenge
#### Split ring
The split-ring is the circle within which the Ultrascope's optical tube sits. It's allowed to swivel and rotate in two axes to orient it towards the stars as needed via the motor control.

#### Stepper motor
A [stepper motor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stepper_motor) (or step motor) is an electric motor that divides a full rotation into a number of equal steps. The motor's position can then be commanded to move and hold at one of these steps without any feedback sensor (an open-loop controller), as long as the motor is carefully sized to the application.
#### STL
