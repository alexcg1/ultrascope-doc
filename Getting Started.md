# Getting Started with Ultrascope Explorer 

This is a guide for brand new users to build and use an Ultrascope Explorer. This guide only covers producing and using the Ultrascope, not modifying it or contributing changes.

## You will need
* A 3D printer
* A laser cutter
* ABS or PLA feedstock
* 1 x Arduino Mega
* 1 x Ultrascope 4.5" mirror
* 1 x Ultrascope Arduino shield (version 0.2)
* 1 x Microsoft Lumia 1020 smartphone
* 1 x Telescope eyepiece
* 3 x RS high torque (.22Nm) stepper motors
* Various nuts and bolts
* Power adapter, USB cables, etc

## Online platforms
|Website|What we use it for|
|-------|------------------|
|[Github](http://www.github.com) | Code, Arduino shield schematics, PCB layout, BOM|
|[Onshape](http://www.onshape.com) | 3D modeling|

## Step by Step
### Forking the repo
1. Make sure you have accounts at Github and Onshape. For OnShape access, please email your contact person at Ultrascope and we'll send you an invite
2. To access the Ultrascope github repository that holds code, etc, email your contact at Ultrascope and ask to become a contributor
3. Fork the Ultrascope github repo

### Printing the scope

### Setting up your laptop

### Setting up the Arduino
1. Plug your Arduino into your PC and get it set up
2. Plug the Ultrascope shield into the Arduino

### Setting up your phone

### Controlling the scope

## Timing and Sequencing
We have sketched out a suggested sequence for the build which is available on Onshape. We will revise this as we go also. This is just meant to be a guide and will be coordinated with the tutorial videos we are planning.
